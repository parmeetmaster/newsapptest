# News Application

This News Application was created as part of a task for Innovaccer. It includes several features:

- **Home Screen**: Displays a list of news articles.
- **Theme Support**: Full theme support across the app.
- **Blog Sharing**: Allows sharing of blogs.
- **Security Considerations**: Sensitive credentials (like API keys) are securely managed in `gradle` and through `method channels`.
- **Custom Widgets**: Includes several custom widgets for a modular and reusable UI.

## Requirements

- **Flutter**: Version 3.22.4. This app uses `fvm` for Flutter version management.
- **Build Runner**: To ensure all generated files are up to date, run:
  ```bash
  fvm flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs --use-polling-watcher
  ```

## Installation

1. **Download and Install APK**: Install the APK directly on your mobile device from the link below:
